Seattle,"Hey folks! It's been a while since we posted one of these and a **lot** of things have happened since the last one. It's been a...year.

Several (several several) users have mentioned that [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/seattle/about/wiki/index) is outdated, and everyone keeps asking for our ""hidden gems"" or ""good neighborhoods to live with a $500 budget"" - and I know we all get a bit tired of the low-effort moving/visiting posts - so I promise we'll update the wiki after you all give us your great recommendations here **üòÄ**

We're using this thread for ""Best of Seattle"" recommendations and other moving/visiting types of info.

We're asking for your collective thoughts on all things to see, do, and eat in Seattle, including but not limited to:

* Neighborhood pros / cons
* Restaurants (best tacos, wings, pizza, etc) -please feel free to add information about things that have changed in terms of  takeout / outdoor seating / etc.
* Breweries
* Dog-friendly venues
* Coffee
* Specialty shops (clothing, bicycles, camera gear, etc)
* Hiking / Backpacking trails
* Tourist attractions
* Date night ideas
* Things to do for free
* Things to do with family

Here's how we'll organize this: If you want to ask about a topic or share info about one, post it as a top-level comment (a reply to the post itself) to create a thread. Please try and search before commenting, we'd like this to be relatively organized so it's easy to search later.

For top-level requests or topics, please try to be relatively generic at first, then drill down into specifics later in that particular thread.

***Please don't spam - No referral codes!***

If you're sharing links to businesses or blogs, please try to add text for context so we know it's a personal recommendation and you're not affiliated with the business.

A quick note: our automod will automatically remove facebook links (please message us if it's the official business page) and shortlinks (bitly, etc).

This post will stay stickied for a bit while it gathers responses, and then we'll move it into the wiki and sidebar so you can continue directing tourists there ;)

Seattle,Hi everyone! I am in need of a hair cut/trim. I have curly semi thick hair and the last 2x I went to get my hair cut it came out horrible. The 1st time the woman gushed on and on about how she loved cutting curly hair etc. It was a nice experience but the haircut sucked. The 2nd time (different place) she just chopped my hair off. Also between those places I came out extremely uneven in the front. It still is but at the time my hair was already really short and I didn't want to take anymore off! I don't wear my hair down alot and with the curls it's hard to tell. My hair now is almost to my waist and just gross on the bottom. So any recommendations and budget friendly would be great.

Seattle,"# Meetup is every Monday, at 7:30 p.m. at Optimism Brewing.

This is an automatically scheduled post for the weekly Capitol Hill Board Game meetup.

Below are details from /u/The_LuftWalrus's original post - please feel free to comment here for coordinating games / rides / attendance / etc - and check their posts for details just in case we miss one that's been modified or cancelled.

&gt;Hey all, the weekly Capitol Hill Board Game meetup is finally back! It will take place every Monday, at 7:30 PM at [Optimism Brewing](https://optimismbrewing.com/), 1158 Broadway (except for when the brewery closes for holidays, employee appreciation events, apocalyptic occurrences, etc.).  
&gt;  
&gt;Start time is typically more like 7:15, as people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. Don't worry if you don't see any games as they'll be brought out soon enough. If you're new, look for me in my bright red Seattle Humane shirt as 9/10 times I'll be coming straight from my volunteer shift. I will also get a reservation for the group so a little placard should be out as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;In regards to food, Optimism does not have a kitchen but does allow food from outside. They also almost always have a food truck show up every night. [Food truck calendar here](https://optimismbrewing.com/food-trucks). *We ask that Please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*  
&gt;  
&gt;FAQ:  
&gt;  
&gt;Q.) *What kind of games are played? Should I bring mine?*  
&gt;  
&gt;A.) A whole slew of games are played; from short games like Codenames and Liars Dice, to longer ones like Evolution and Scythe. And feel free to bring your own games, too. You might find some people who are interested in trying it out.  
&gt;  
&gt;Q.) *I don't really know how to play any board games besides x, y, z.... Will I be welcome here?*  
&gt;  
&gt;A.) That's completely fine. There are plenty of people who are willing to explain the rules, and do quite a good job at it, too.  
&gt;  
&gt;Q.) *Speaking of being welcome, what kind of people are allowed to attend?*  
&gt;  
&gt;A.) Everyone is welcome, so long as you are polite, respectful, and considerate of the other patrons. Also know that Optimism is a dog friendly bar, so bring your pup if you'd like. And if you're allergic, be sure to take any medicine before attending.  
&gt;  
&gt;Q.) *I don't drink alcohol, but want to be supportive of Optimism. How can I still be a good patron?*  
&gt;  
&gt;A.) Optimism also sells a non alcoholic $1 bubbly, crisp, sparkling water that I have enjoyed before. And if you can't handle any sort of carbonation, then there's no need to buy anything. You can support Optimism in another ways: telling your friends about the venue, grabbing and bussing any glasses someone may have left behind at another table while on your way out, etc.",Monday Capitol Hill Board Game Night: 7:30 pm at Optimism

But the Sounder travels through ballard every day.  How much easier would it be to just put a train station in ballard than any plan they have to add rail, that probably won't happen in my working lifetime.

Seattle,"UPDATE: Zipcar‚Äôs Twitter handle was super helpful, they got back to me this morning and after checking all the pictures/videos that I had sent, they were able to refund all the extra money I was charged. 

Old post:

I had a really scary and frustrating experience with their service today. Please be careful when using their cars later in the evenings and on weekends, as you‚Äôd be on your own when dealing with emergencies üòî 

No matter what your situation is, they do not have a customer support line open after 9:30pm on weekdays. Emergencies will go unanswered - whether they affect you monetarily or you‚Äôre in real danger or harm. I found it crazy that they take customer support so casually. 

Re-Posting this from a thread that I tweeted at their official handle (after I exhausted all other ways of contacting them) , hopefully it‚Äôll help people avoid what I went through. 

‚ÄîSTART‚Äî

Had a horrible experience with @Zipcar today in Seattle. People please be aware of using their services - you‚Äôll not only feel frustrated and helpless, but also lose a lot of money for no mistake of yours. The customer support DOES NOT work after 9:30pm even in emergencies. 

My trip was supposed to end at 9:30pm but the parking spot was occupied by other cars. Tried calling support since 910pm and he kept saying I should instead try finding a street parking around the original spot. I was encircling 5 blocks in ALL directions for 2 hours!

After 9:30pm nobody picks up their phone - Even if you are in an emergency! After 2hours I lost my patience and gave up on finding a parking, there was literally no free street parking on a Friday night on Capitol Hill!

Things then got even worse, the car refused to start (in a load zone) after I shut it down. I couldn‚Äôt do anything - their phone wasn‚Äôt working, no emergency 24/7 number to contact. I was stranded, luckily in a quiet spot and not somewhere scary - but it was a tow zone!

Realising there‚Äôs nothing else I could do, I got out of there and got an Uber back to my apartment. Luckily I was just 5 minutes away and my phone was working fine, so wasn‚Äôt much trouble. But I have been charged $200 worth of penalties and the car will possibly get towed and they will add type towing charges on my account - the  support guy told me that on phone! I have called them at least 20 times in the last 4 hours - it‚Äôs 1am and I still have not been able to reach them. It‚Äôs been the worst customer experience of my life @Zipcar which is why I‚Äôm sharing this here - hopefully someone from @Zipcar will get in touch. If you‚Äôve read this far, please be very careful when you use their services - especially during non-support or rush hours like Friday nights! Just way too many red flags.


‚Äî-END‚Äî-

I hope this experience can make others aware of potential issues, so they don‚Äôt have to go through what I did. I don‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôm going to end up paying them in total - so far I‚Äôve been charged $224.92 for a trip that was supposed to cost  $30. They‚Äôll probably add another $250 of towing fees to this, and there‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôve been able to do - just feel so helpless here.",PSA: Zipcar Warning - Worst Imaginable Experience

Seattle,"Edit: Since this post got more attention than I expected, just wanted to say I do have Xfinity service, the tech who came out was just wrong. But this has turned into a general thread to complain about how awful ISPs are and how monopolistic it is, so feel free to vent if that's what you came here for. I just don't want to go spreading misinformation.

Yes, I'm sure that can't actually be the case, but it's what every ISP has told me so far.

I bought a house in Shoreline recently and the only company who claimed to service it was Comcast. Not my favorite, but at least it's fast. So today the tech comes out and tells me my house isn't connected and it would take them a month to get someone here to connect it. She said there was fiber from Ziply run to the house. 

I work from home and would lose my job if I couldn't work for a month. But Ziply sounds good, so I call them. Apparently despite being in Shoreline, I'm in a Seattle service area so they don't service this house. They tell me I'm in CenturyLink's area. 

According to CenturyLink's website, they don't service this address. I've been on hold with them for 15 minutes now hoping that somehow the website is wrong. But seriously... How can my only option in Shoreline be satellite internet? 

Has anyone experienced this before?

Update: after 45 minutes on the phone with CenturyLink, they don't service this address either.

Update 2: I talked with an Xfinity rep (who btw was shockingly helpful and competent) and she told me the tech they sent out is almost definitely incorrect. This house had Xfinity back in August, so it almost certainly still does. They're sending another tech tomorrow morning. It's still atrocious that this is the state of broadband access in the US (and a major metropolitan area at that).

Update 3: Got it solved! Turns out I had Xfinity service this whole time. The house has 6 coax outlets and I'd tried 5 of them. One was well hidden so I just now found it. Turns out it's getting service. Pretty sad the tech who came out couldn't tell me that...

Walking and talking again was difficult but in no way even close to the difficulty living with what I'm still working through. I have impulse control problems that if my emotional state isn't well I can be dangerous. I can also be mean, forgetful, depressed, suicidal, cognitive overload at times and bat shit crazy.

And no permit. They say they don't need a permit to block because they have City Approved Outdoor Seating Permit. They block the parking a number of days before they set up their tables, etc. Lately some of the tenants have been taking the signs allowing residents and others to park. Our bldg Manager has been to the restaurant to talk to the manager there. He says he doesn't have to show anyone a permit. With cars parked there, he can't set up tables. He tells our manager to give back signs. Our manager tells him residents have them. Ask the ones who took them. A battle of wills for sure.

And yet, he doesn't call to have cars towed! So how can we find out if he has a City Permit to set up outdoor seating and to block parking for 2-3 days leading up to the days he usually sets up the seating? Which department does that? or is there more than one place? And if we find he has no permit who do we complain too?

It's not that we don't mind his set up. It's only two nights a week. But he blocks parking 2-3 days ahead of time. Even blocking parking spaces where he Never sets up seating.

Seattle,"We have a Stickley couch that goes for something around $6K new.  Ours is 20 years old, and we haven't kept the leather oiled as it should have been, and our cat has put some light scratch marks here and there.  With a moderate amount of effort, it would look fantastic.  Making it somewhat more desirable, the lead-times for this furniture (when buying new) are pretty long, like half a year or more.

We'd like to sell it, but we're hoping to sell to a company (like a used furniture store) who would take it as it is and pick it up.  We're not expecting to make a fortune on it, but it's worth something.

We haven't been able to find a store or business that buys furniture like this, which surprises us.

Seattle,"From the previous post on this subject, there were some strong opinions on using Goretex/waterproof gear. I wanted to start a new thread and offer my experience (mindful that yours may vary)
1. Goretex running shoes have kept my feet dry only if I wore trail gaiters (e.g. Altra, Salomon) with them. Otherwise water will come in from the sides and your feet will get wet.
2. Having rain pants along with gaiters gives me the opportunity to rinse off the inevitable grit, sand or mud that comes from running in the rain.
3. Washing my rain jacket and pants and then applying a water repellent treatment like Revivex makes a big difference in maintaining the effectiveness of my rain gear.

After parking on the street overnight, I found that some asshole has sawed off my catalytic converter. This will cost me roughly $1,700 to repair. For context, I was parked not far from the Elliot Bay Book Company / SCC.

Your police appear to be completely worthless. Besides the fact that people are clearly doing this with impunity, the non-emergency police phone number isn't even answered by a person. Instead you get directed to a website built by the world's stupidest web developer in order to fill out your report (want to see something funny? Try filling out a vehicle theft report using this with an iPhone: [https://secure.coplogic.com/dors/en/filing/selectincidenttype?dynparam=1637092268239](https://secure.coplogic.com/dors/en/filing/selectincidenttype?dynparam=1637092268239) ). I have absolutely no expectation that filling out this report will amount to anything; it even says this in the reporting app:

""I understand that most online reports do not receive follow-up investigation because they are primarily intended to gather valuable statistical data, and I acknowledge that I have no expectation of follow-up investigation for this report.""

All reporting does is provide your fair city with more statistics about how crappy it is. Congratulations - that much seems clear already.

I used to be a major fan of Seattle. Needless to say, I won't be visiting Seattle again. I'm sure you don't care; one less person on the road, right? Also less money into your economy, but fine. I hope more people see this and take heed to stay away from that crime-ridden cesspool.

Good luck Seattle. You seem to be in desperate need of it.

Sincerely, a fellow Washingtonian.

\--- edit ---

Many seem to think I believe the police should be prepared to do more for me personally. I never said that. My case is just one of many, I'm sure. I would hope that the police recognize that this crime is rampant and try to at least fight it by going after those who market in stolen goods. And it would be nice if it were easier to report this issue.

I realize my experience is anecdotal and I'm probably just incredibly unlucky. It is what it is. But for me personally, it's enough to justify staying away. So long and thanks for all the fish.

But the pass would have unlimited rides for that month so long as you traveled within that zones limits. 

The passes here (which there are several types apparently) seem to be a glorified pre-paid card. Am I understanding that right? You have to make sure it is holding enough funds so you can ride the bus, rail, ferry, whatever that day? That seems like there is no true incentive to even getting the pass except for maybe ease of payment. And now I still have to worry about the fares for each mode of transportation. 

This can‚Äôt be how it is done. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me to buy a monthly pass when it doesn‚Äôt make my transit that much easier or cost effective. If it was an unlimited ride pass, that would make sense.

I have talked to strangers, gone to shows, downloaded bumble BFF, joined Facebook groups, etc. and talked to a bunch of people with no sustenance when I try to make any plans. I have The Nudge texts, follow curioseattle on Instagram, and am always looking for things to do, but no one ever wants to follow through. It is the most bizarre experience and I have no idea how to combat the recurring heartbreaking flakiness of the people I‚Äôve met. 
(I know I sound so pessimistic about this but I‚Äôm just hurt it happened AGAIN.)

I made a solid group of friends this summer and we hung out at least once a week- but around the end of September, everyone started dropping off to the point we all barely talk anymore. If I send a message it‚Äôs just ‚Äúseen‚Äù by everyone. 

I know it takes ambition to make friends, so I try to make the first move and plan things (also because I enjoy planning!) but I am so tired of being ghosted and flaked on last minute. I had plans to meet some people last Friday too, and waited at the restaurant for 20 minutes only to have both of them text excuses saying they wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it. 

I took this personally at first- thinking it MUST be me or something I was doing wrong- but after almost a year here I am noticing it‚Äôs just the energy in everyone? People are super nice and they‚Äôll talk to you, but there is no way to get over the wall everyone puts up, and no way to coax a deeper friendship out of anyone I have met. It‚Äôs made me so sad that I‚Äôve been considering leaving Seattle at some point- which I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever want to do.

I‚Äôm so used to having friends that want to come over for movie nights, games, or dinners- or go to museums or coffee shops. I have never been bailed on repeatedly and left feeling so empty and alone in my life. I feel like Washington offers everything I could ever want except for a real sense of community. Walking through my neighborhood and seeing big groups of friends- I just want to ask them how the heck they found each other because it just hasn‚Äôt worked yet for me. 

I know it was ridiculously easy in college because I was in organizations where community was offered. My hobbies don‚Äôt exactly have community behind them- so I‚Äôm not sure how to meet people that will stick around. I‚Äôm not into sports, and not super into trivia- which seems to be the main suggestion?

If you have cracked the code to friendship here, please share your success story. If you have suggestions, advice, or words of affirmation- I would love to hear it all because I AM WAY TOO YOUNG AND SEXY TO BE SAD. /:

Seattle,"Hi r/Seattle

I moved into an apartment recently and have been struggling to deal with the high humidity over the past few months (Sep - Nov). The humidity has been consistently 80%+ relative humidity and its affecting our furniture and isn't great for ourselves or our pet. Some info on the property.

* Unit is \~700sqft apartment, which we rent. Built in 1950's, wood frame with brick exterior. Two apartments adjacent and one below. Hot water heating in the kitchen (under countertop)
* The bathroom does not have a fan, it only has a window &amp; electric fan heater. This is what I suspected as the primary culprit. So as a result I have placed a small dehumidifier in the room and shower with the heater on &amp; window open a few inches
* I have one other small [dehumidifier](https://www.target.com/p/pure-enrichment-dry-deluxe-dehumidifier-white/-/A-54383203) in the bedroom, same as the bathroom.
* The only remedy has been to open windows and blast circulating fan, which drops it about 10-30% RH over a few hours.

Seattle,"Has anyone driven through the intersection of Delridge Way SW and SW Holden St since they updated the striping and signal? I feel like the signal confuses a lot of people. Unfortunately it's not updated in Google Streetview yet so I'll just have to explain it.

In short, my question is: Does this signal confuse others or were the drivers I encountered in the scenarios below just a fluke?

When you're driving south on Delridge, and turning right onto Holden, the right turn signal is red when traffic going straight on Delridge has a green light. At that time the bike signal is also green. There is a ""no turn on red\*"" signal next to the arrow signal, to prevent cars from turning across bike traffic. I will be abiding by this law and get honked at and yelled at. When the green right arrow is on, then traffic going straight on Delridge has a red light, so now the ""no turn on red\*"" sign confuses other drivers and they'll just stay stopped not even realizing they have a green arrow.

\*EDIT: Typo corrected

I'd love other people's input on their experience at this signal because I'm tempted to contact SDOT about it. I drive through this intersection almost every day and see people do the craziest things and get so aggressive all because they don't seem to understand the purpose of the lights and signs. I work in traffic engineering and am genuinely curious why the signal is set the way it is (edit: I understand the intent but it seems to confuse enough people that I worry there will be a bad road rage incident because people don't understand the signage/signal), and how it is causing confusing for general users. If a signal isn't clear to the end user, the it was likely designed badly.",Confusing signal at Delridge and Holden

I am a social studies teacher that has been teaching AP for a couple years now from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. I currently teach at a Title 1 school and do not mind teaching at similar underfunded schools. My question in general was:

Seattle,"I've been living on the East Side in Kirkland during the pandemic. Moved here about a year ago. It's nice, but I feel pretty isolated and bored. I'm in a house and not Downtown Kirkland. Though I do really like Downtown Kirkland the crowd seems a bit older than what I'd like. I'm in my early 20s and so I was thinking Cap Hill or Fremont would be better.

The only thing holding me back is the commute. I work in Redmond, right off of one of the exits on 520. I hear mixed things about whether the commute is worth it or that bad. I've got a car, but I'm not opposed to taking a bus. Any thoughts?

I should add, we'll have hybrid work next year - so it'll just be 3 days a week in the office, 2 days at home. Can even leave the office earlier and do some work back at home or on the bus to beat the evening rush hour if I have to. I'm not sure if the feeling of isolation/boredom is solely due to living in Kirkland, since we are in the midst of the pandemic still.

Seattle,"Hey Everyone,

So this Friday Im flying in to stay with a friend for the weekend. We pretty much have everything planned after he gets off work till I leave Sunday.

I land at 12 and friend doesn't get off until about 6. He works near the Northgate drop-off, and will pick me up there but I have that in-between time to do something. I've been to Seattle a few times and seen all the ""Must See"" stuff, so what I'm really looking to do is a DIY Brew Tour just need some locals approval of breweries close to the tram. I will have a small carryon fwiw.

Here's my list so far along the tram that, from using the vague map online with yelps brewery list, that I can possibly walk to.

\-Flying Lion

\-Perihelion

\-Ghostfish

\-Watershed

Are these going to be close enough to stations? - I'm open to any other recommendations, not against a good dive bar either. And if anyone wants to meet up and join the tour thatd be cool!

Thanks! Looking forward to some rain from an Phoenician.

Edit: Ill also be hungry after the flight so one with great seafood would be cool haha

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit 2: Getting a lot of really good help with this. Heres what I have so far**

1- Get off at Beacon Hill for Perihelion lunch &amp; beers

2- Off at SODO station for Seapine (possibly Ghostfish? mixed reviews) Might cut this stop out to make time to go more into downtown

3- Off at Westlake for Old Stone &amp; Cloudburst

4- Off at U Station and scooter to Ravenna- scooter to Roosevelt Station

5- Watershed @ Northgate for final beers and pickup.

I think this is going to be my list! If there are any places within a stones throw of these places that I should check out also let me know! i.e local B&amp;M places.",Brewery tour along the tram from SeaTac to Northgate

Wanted to ask a few questions about what cycling is like in the city. Especially coming from being a regular bike commuter in NYC, I want to know how it compares, what to expect, and how to fit in:

* Is it typical for cyclists to Idaho Stop at intersections? So far I've seen a lot of cyclists waiting at red lights even when no one's around. Will I get judged for doing an Idaho Stop?
* In NYC cyclists tend to clump together during busy hours, especially when crossing roads, for a bit of safety in numbers and friendly pack mentality. Are cyclists in Seattle friendly and want to acknowledge / ride in a pack of strangers, or are people expecting to be left alone / solitary riding in the bike lane?
* In NYC it's not allowed to ride on sidewalks. What's the culture here like for roads without bike lanes? Use sidewalks? Vehicular Cycling?
* What's the culture like around the bikeshare e-bikes? Do ""regular"" cyclists have disdain or superiority towards people who are using the bikeshare bikes?
* What's the car/cyclist/pedestrian relationship like? In NYC everyone hates cyclists. True here?
* How strict are laws and enforcement by police? I know people in NYC who've gotten major, pricy tickets for running a red light, biking with earbuds in both ears, small stuff. Is getting pulled over a worry here?
* Any must-have gear for rainy weather cycling?
* What else should I be aware of?

Seattle,"So I been battling severe depressing and anxiety for long time and recently have been losing my battle with them. I refuse medicating due to personal reasons and recovering addict as well, and have found needed support thru close friends and significant others to work in my favor of the support I need to remind myself that I got this, that I am strong enough. Well last month or so I've gone thru a lot changes in life and even decided it was time for a much needed change of scenery to get away from some these demons attacking me. That's probably best idea I've had in a long time and honestly will be the best outcome as well. However I've find that in making preperations in this ""new life restart"" I have lost a lot of my support I've had to continue moving forward; I've lost friends that turn their backs on me, I've lost family that just don't seem to give a shit anymore, I've even lost a woman I love dearly due to my demons being such a burden to myself that I in turn start to be a burden onto others... I don't mean nor want to be a burden, it's simply something I have zero control of at times and apologies don't come close to how I actually feel about it.... What I'm getting at really is that I'm seeking and desperately needing to find friends that either have lived thru this nightmare themselves or have been around others and have knowledge of these demons and can help provide support and knowledge if needed....

Seattle,"Hi, I am considering a move to Seattle. 

I've learned over the years that it is good to be involved in local activities when you move to a new place. For example, in Chicago, it was good to get into arts and architecture. There, I was able to meet people through art classes and museum first Fridays. The bars and the food scene were great too. Summers were precious - outdoor concerts in the park, biking along Lakeshore, and swimming in the lake. 

In Los Angeles, I met people through surfing, freediving, fitness classes, and regular road trips. Lazy beach days in San Onofre, diving for lobsters, and impromptu workout sessions with strangers in the OMB in Santa Monica are some of my fond memories. Communing with the otherworldly beings while dancing under the full moon out in the desert - that's also one of my favorite LA things. 

I'm thinking I could go crabbing in Puget Sounds like how I go lobstering in LA. I'm thinking the bars may come alive for sporting events the way they do in Chicago. Maybe I should learn Jeet Kun Do where it all began. I guess I can surf for some months. But I really want to get deep into a truly Seattle thing or two.

* Ice Chips
   * What: Xylitol-based, sugar-free hard candies.
   * Who: Ice Chips Candy LLC in Yelm.
   * Notes: Founded in 2009, Ice Chips have appeared in Shark Tank. They're based on xylitol, a sugar-alcohol with a very low glycemic index.
* Jaipur Avenue
   * What: Instant chai mixes.
   * Who: Jaipur Avenue in Seattle.
   * Notes: Founded in 2010, a Seattle based chai company creating both mixes for cafe service and individually packed instant chai packets.  Actually good, milky chai from a dangerously convenient packet.
* Moon Cheese
   * What: Cheese dried through a vacuum microwave process.
   * Who: NutraDried Food Company LLC in Ferndale.
   * Notes: Founded in 2013 based on technology developed in conjunction with the University of British Columbia. Using a microwave vacuum process (Radiant Energy Vacuum) it's possible to dry cheese using less overall energy without it melting or cooking.
* Frango Meltaways or Dilettante TruffleCremes
   * What: Wrapped chocolate-covered, melt-in-your-mouth chocolate ganache.
   * Who: Seattle Chocolate Company in Tukwila or Dilettante Chocolates in Kent.
   * Notes: This form of truffle was created by the Frederick &amp; Nelson's department stores over 100 years ago. That chain was since purchased by what is now Macy's and the Frango brand name has changed hand a few times. Today, Meltaways are produced by Seattle Chocolates and sold under that name by license. Dilettante, another Seattle chocolate founded in 1976, makes a very nice version of this called TruffleCremes which might be easier to get.
* Fancy caramels or truffles from Fran's, Intrigue, Seleu≈°s, or others
   * What: Fancy artisanal truffles, caramels, chocolate-covered fruits and nuts, and so on.
   * Who: Fran's Chocolate in Seattle, Intrigue Chocolate Co. in Seattle, Seleu≈°s Chocolates in Seattle, and others.
   * Notes: Seattle has a large artisanal chocolate scene, many of whom have made their names creating truffles and other confectioneries.  Fran's is probably the most established of the upscale names, and they make an excellent chocolate covered orange peel, but I'm also a fan of Intrigue's truffles which tend to have tons of depth and complex flavor.
* Nice chocolate bars from JCoCo / Seattle Chocolates, Theo, or others
   * What: Upscale, culinarily inspired, chocolate bars.
   * Who: Seattle Chocolate Company in Tukwila, Theo Chocolate in Seattle, and others.
   * Notes: Theo arguably helped popularize the high-end chocolate bar market, and their products can now be found nation-wide.  Seattle Chocolates was founded in 1991 and JCoCo is their new upscale line of flavored bars.  A portion of JCoCo sales is donated to food banks in Washington, California, and New York.
* Salumi salami
   * What: Italian-style dry salami.
   * Who: Salumi in Seattle.
   * Notes: Founded by the father of Mario Batali, and IMO, one of the best salumerias in the US.  With new ownership in 2017, they intended to pursue national distribution, but the salami is still excellent.
* Beecher's cheese
   * What: Firm cheeses, especially the Flagship cheddar.
   * Who: Beecher's Handmade Cheese in Seattle.
   * Notes: Founded in the Pike Place Market in 2003, Beecher's is well-regarded for their sharp and salty Flagship cheddar and related cheeses, having won multiple national and international awards.
* Chukar Cherries
   * What: Cherry-based candies, snacks, and dried fruit, such as dried Rainier cherries and chocolate covered cherries.
   * Who: Chukar Cherries in Prosser.
   * Notes: Founded in 1988, named after the chukar bird, a relative of the partridge that lives between the Cascade and Rocky ranges.  Rainier cherries are a cultivar of cherry developed at WSU, with a yellow and red blush color known for their especially sweet and low acidity flavor.
* Salmon jerky / candy or smoked salmon
   * What: Pacific salmon that's been smoked or cut into strips and sugar-cured into jerky.
   * Who: Alaska Smokehouse in Woodinville, Seattle Fish Guys in Seattle, Totem Smokehouse in Seattle, and others.
   * Notes: Salmon has always been a big part of PNW cuisine dating back to its importance with local indigenous tribes.  Today, even among non-native peoples, the popularity of hot-smoking salmon rather than simple cold salt-curing (as in lox) comes from how indigenous tribes prepare and preserve salmon.
* Almond Roca
   * What: Buttercrunch toffee with almonds coated in chocolate.
   * Who: Brown &amp; Haley in Tacoma.
   * Notes: Founded in 1914 by Harry Brown and JC Haley.  Almond Roca was invented in 1923 and named by Tacoma's head librarian after the Spanish word for rock.  It was advertised to keep better than most candies and was shipped to troops in WW2.
* Aplets &amp; Cotlets
   * What: A regional take on Turkish delight using local apples and apricots (and other fruits).
   * Who: Liberty Orchards Co. Inc. in Cashmere.
   * Notes: Founded in 1918 as an orchard by two Armenian immigrants. Invented in the 1940s as a way to use surplus orchard fruit. In 2009, a bill was introduced to the Washington State legislature to designate Aplets &amp; Cotlets as the state candy, but this ultimately failed due to conflict between different agricultural regions and the fact that many people thought that honor should go to Almond Roca.
* Coffee
   * What: Locally roasted coffee from any of the excellent rosters in the area.
   * Who: Herkimer Coffee in Seattle, Elm Coffee Roasters in Seattle, Slate Coffee Roasters in Seattle, Tony's Coffee in Bellingham, and so many others.
   * Notes: Seattle famously has a big coffee scene, with many local roasters even prior to Starbucks becoming a thing.  Some of the ones listed here are newer, but it would be more challenging to find bad coffee from a cafe than good.",A Very Seattle Gift Basket

Seattle,"I live in the West Woodland/Ballard area. This morning I realized that my car had been gently raided sometime in the past 24 hours. Very gently. So gently that I almost didn't notice it. 

I went to get something out of my trunk about an hour ago, and when I went to lock my car again, it let me know that there was a door open. Odd. I haven't used the car since Saturday, and I very distinctly remember locking it and standing there until the lights went off , since I have a bad track record of leaving a light on and running the battery out. So a) the door shouldn't have been open in the first place, and b) if it was, my battery would have died and I wouldn't have been able to get into my trunk this morning. 

I got in the car to see which door was open (it turned out to be the rear passenger, shut but not latched) and that's when I realized my glove compartment was open and some contents had been emptied onto the passenger seat. Looking around, I also saw that my center console was open. Someone had clearly looked for cash/valuables in my car.

What makes this weird to me is:

* Nothing had been taken. I had some fairly expensive hiking boots in my backseat, a deflated and easily portable air mattress, some non-perishable groceries. Everything is still there.
* My car is parked outside my house and I've been home since I last used my car two days ago. I never heard an alarm, there is no damage to my car, and I still have my only set of keys, so I don't know how they got in without setting an alarm off. 
   * NOTE: My car has a weird defect where if you use the physical key to unlock the door, the alarm goes off. I need to use my key fob to unlock the doors and then the physical key to start the car. 
* Like I mentioned, I was able to get into my car this morning, so it must have happened recently enough that the battery didn't die even with a door open. 
* I'm pretty sure this is not the first time this happened to me. About a year ago, I was living in a different area up north of the city, and I got into my car to find that my glove compartment was open and the contents spilled out. Again, nothing taken, no damage to my car, etc. It was weird, and I made a note of it, but didn't really have any plan since there wasn't any harm done.

Seattle,"Heya! I'm self employed so my options for health and dental are thru WA Health Plan finder. Has anyone signed up for it and can share if they found it valuable? It seems like a pretty bad deal to me - am I missing something?

There's only 3 plans available, here's the plan comparison:  https://imgur.com/018XNnP 

TL;DR - only exams and cleanings are fully covered, cavities are only covered 50% after deductible, and there is no root canal/crown/surgery coverage at all. Last year, I remember there was a 6 month wait period between procedures too, tho it seems to be gone now (unless it's hidden in the fine print). Oh and the benefit max is $1k, while you're already paying $300-400/yr in premiums.

It seems like the only way to break even is to have full checkup/cleaning and like 3+ cavity fillings every single year. If my teeth aren't constantly dying, then it'd prolly be cheaper to just pay out of pocket myself. I thought ""well maybe it'd be good to have in case of emergency..."" but it explicitly doesn't cover any oral emergencies, so what's the point.

I absolutely know I'm not the only person in this position either so what am I supposed to do? Shell out $1-2k for a dog from a breeder? This seems like what I'll likely have to do honestly.

And by living in an apartment, I'm already pretty limited on what breed and size of dog I'm allowed to have so these rules make it 10x harder to find something that works for me.

First I noticed they dropped the Q and emphasized the Fox part of their name. Then I noticed they seemed to be plugging national Fox News coverage into the morning news. Once they started plugging in Fox News national coverage I started watching KIRO.

Seattle,"Hello!

So last year I had to drive through the pass with like half a foot of snow, and I'll probably have to do the same thing this year too.

I put on my chain, which states that I shouldn't exceed 30 mph with it. The thing is, I've seen bunch of people put on chains but everyone else seemed to go faster than me who was going 30-33 mph. I don't want to be that car that holds up everyone else behind me, but I'm also not comfortable going above 30 with my chains on.

I have an all-weather tire on with a AWD sedan, so I feel like I could get by without having chains on this year as long as I don't go fast, but I wanted to see what you guys think since I haven't had to do that before.

What do you guys think? Thanks",Driving through the Pass with Chain

Seattle,"Pasta Freska was an Italian restaurant in Seattle with no menu - you just told the chef/server the general theme of what you like (e.g. seafood, marinara vs pesto sauce, prefer small tapas vs big entrees, any allergies etc), and then they'll bring out food based on preferences. The price point was good also, like average Seattle restaurant cost, not Canlis level pricing.

Hey r/Seattle! I'm running the Seattle Marathon at the end of the month and I have a few questions I'm hoping someone here can answer.

&amp;#x200B;

First, why in the world is the marathon always the weekend after Thanksgiving?? The weather is pretty much guaranteed to be terrible and now I have to actually think about what I'm eating on Turkey Day. Why wouldn't they have it in one of the lovely summer months?!

&amp;#x200B;

But more importantly, I went on a training run of most the course this weekend and now I am pretty confused about the elevation gain (1788 ft) stated on the website. The [course is here](https://www.plotaroute.com/route/1680175) and as you can see most of it is on the Burke Gillman Trail, which I discovered this weekend is fairly flat. The only part of the course I did not run is the portion crossing the Ship Canal Bridge and onto the highway. My 22 miler this weekend (including the Warren G.Manguson Park) was only 479 ft gain. Could it be possible that the rest of the elevation is in those few miles across the bridge?

Seattle," Hey, has anyone here taken their ebikes or large bikes, specifically oversized fat tire ones like the RadWagon 4 I have, on an Amtrak train before? (Portland -&gt; Seattle &amp; back, amtrak cascades in my case.)

I'm asking because my bike is a bit over Amtraks weight limit and size restrictions, but not by much. I've read that others have brought Ebikes similar to mine over the limit but the conductor let it slide, or didn't notice. However I haven't read anything about the RadWagon 4, it's also quite a bit longer than any other ebike (can hold 3 adults/350 pounds, its a long cargo bike).

I'm not looking specifically for people with the same bike as me, but just anyone whos taken a ebike or large bike on an Amtrak (specifically in Portland/Seattle if possible) before and how it went (maybe i'd have to take off the handlebars/front wheel, etc).

My lease is up and my rent was raised from **$1,800** to a new rate of **$2,088** (**14 month lease**). Actually, $2,088 is only ***IF*** I renew by tomorrow, otherwise new rate will be $2,142. 

Not happy, so I emailed manager and asked if we could negotiate this down to $1,900. She said ""***NO""***. And said ""In fact, this $2,088 I'm getting is a steal for the current market"". This might be true but $1,800 to $2088 is quite a jump and I'm considering moving out to a different apartment. 

The manager also did say I could wait and see if the market rate drops a little around January. I like this idea. Obviously the risk here is that if I wait until January and rates do NOT drop, I'll be left scrambling for an apartment or pay the crazy price to renew my lease.

Seattle,"In a different post in r/Seattle, the top comment was a question about if people had begun to recognize that there are two main groups of homeless people. I thought this fact was widely recognized, but perhaps not. So here I am resharing what I posted there.

Every single study on homelessness identifies that there are two distinct groups of people who suffer from homelessness, either explicitly or implicitly through distinct distributions in the data they present. These are often referred to as the **chronically homeless** (or episodically homeless) and the **transitionally homeless**. These two groups have distinctly different causes for entering homelessness, demographics, durations and rates of recurrence of homelessness, behaviors while homeless, and make up significantly different proportions of the homeless population.

Certainly I recognize that these two groups are by no means completely distinct, and no one individual may fit perfectly into these descriptions, but this is the first step toward a more nuanced understanding of the problem of homelessness.

The **transitionally homeless** make up the vast majority, about two thirds, of the homeless population. The transitionally homeless are more likely to become homeless because of rent and job insecurity, they are more likely to avail themselves of shelters and services. The transitionally homeless are likely to be homeless for less than two months and are likely to have only one period of homelessness in a three year timespan. Almost all homeless families are transitionally homeless. The transitionally homeless are more likely to find indoor shelter and hold some form of job and so may not be recognized as homeless so many people are unware of the size of this group.

One the other hand, the **chronically homeless** are about twice as likely as the transitionally homeless to suffer from mental health problems and substance abuse problems. More than two thirds of the chronically homeless have suffered from lifelong substance abuse and mental health problems. These challenges likely led to their initial and recurring loss of housing. The chronically homeless are homeless for longer periods of time than the transitionally homeless, are more likely to be outside and visible (hence sometimes referred to as the visibly homeless), and are more likely to experience recurring episodes of homelessness.

Because the transitionally homeless make up the vast majority of the homeless population, and rent-to-income disparity is typically the cause of their entering homelessness, it is certainly true that policies to tackle affordable housing and income security will make the biggest impact on the size of the homeless population. However, such policies will not necessarily have the biggest impact on the net *suffering* of the homeless population, since the physical and emotional experiences of these two groups is likely vastly different. Furthermore, the negative impacts of encampments on public spaces and public safety are disproportionately caused by the chronically homeless, so to reduce these particular impacts we should focus resources on mental health and drug addiction.

Not recognizing the different natures of these two populations is a major inhibitor to improving the situation. Worse, conflating these two populations by suggesting that adding more housing capacity is the only or best solution to reducing homelessness is either ignorant of the data, ideologically or politically motivated, or hides a bias in who should be allowed to suffer (perhaps valuing the suffering of families over that of drug users).

A few more specific numbers to support my above statements. You will find similar numbers in many studies:

* 30%-40% of people experiencing homelessness are part of a family experiencing homelessness, but almost all (90%) of them are sheltered \[2, page 7\]\[1, page 30\].

* Over a three year period, the transitionally homelessness typically experience 1.4 shelter stays lasting two months. On the other hand, the chronically homeless typically experience 4.9 shelter stays each lasting just under two months \[2, page 5\].

* 20%-27% of people experiencing homelessness are 'chronically homeless' \[2, page 1\]\[1, page 20\].

* Over 60% of the chronically homelessness have experienced lifetime mental health problems \[2, page 4\].

* 80% of the chronically homelessness have experienced lifetime alcohol and/or drug problems \[2, page 4\].

* Chronically homeless are \~1.8 times more likely to suffer from mental illness \[2, page 6\].

* Chronically homeless are \~1.6 times more likely to struggle with substance abuse \[2, page 6\].

* Transitionally homelessness constitute 80% of shelter users \[2, page 4\].

* Chronically homelessness comprise 10% of shelter users \[2, page 5\].

* 35% of those outside of shelters are chronically homeless \[1, page 20\].

* 60-80% of homeless people report that rent/income support could have prevented their their homelessness, while 20-40% of homeless people report that mental health and drug abuse programs could have prevented their their homelessness \[3\].

Seattle,"I don't mean the short ""beep"" people do to let someone know the light has turned green. I mean the 8 to 10 second long laying on the horn, and the honking in situations that don't merit it at all.

Just the other day I saw someone trying to get into a parking spot on a street. A car came up behind them, honked their horn, and then went around them. The going around them proved that the horn wasn't necessary in the first place. Just go around them in silence.

Then 2 days ago I was on I-5 and I needed to get over. I checked my mirror several times and made sure the car that was behind me to the right was going a consistent speed and they were. I got over in front of them and they honked at me as if I had just cut them off, despite us both going consistent speeds for a reasonable amount of time.

Lastly, I live downtown and I constantly hear people laying on their horn for 10 seconds or more. Usually because someone has made a mistake or or is stuck in a turn, or something, and the person behind them just honks endlessly as if that person wasn't already aware that they fucked up. Like thank goodness you honked for 10 seconds. If you had only honked for 2 seconds I would have never known I was in the way.

Sometime next year January, A friend and I will be either in NYC or Seattle as our first entry point in US.

Now, I have to be in both of these cities, so where I go after them depends on which my 2nd city is. So if i land in NYC and then go to Seattle, then I would prefer to stick to the west coast.

\- Party / night life. ngl, some booze, some music, a bit of dancing with the ladies

\- good city vibes. so nice cafes, restaurants, events happening around to explore

\- nature, in and around the city

\- just chill in general. So some places with nice BnBs

\- Experience local American culture. Something that is delightful but not really shown much in Hollywood movies

Seattle,"Friday is here, winter is arriving and it's time to prepare. We know there are a lot of questions and rumors out there about what winter operations will look like this year. Our blog below addresses a lot of that, but the short story:

Yes, our crews will be plowing highways. They'll be working hard to keep up as best as possible. No, it won't be the same level of service as the past. We typically have about 1,500 people in jobs tied most directly to winter, and this year we have 1,200. That means that some roads may not be plowed as frequently as years past and some closures may last longer. So it's vital that everyone be sure they and their vehicle are prepared before heading out. Please take a few minutes to read the blog for more details and information.

Seattle,"What would it take to make that a reality? Would anything be different? Would we still face the same problems? Should we make this a goal for Seattle?

I can't help but have the feeling that perhaps there's a simple solution to everything that we're struggling with as a community and just by reframing and thinking about our problems in a different way we could maybe end up solving all the problems we're currently trying to tackle head on.

I was reading some book I forgot what it was I think something on agile project management, but I think the problem has been potentially to find too quickly and we need to redefine it as something different if we want to end up solving most of the things we're trying to solve.

So maybe the problem isnt housing affordability. But housing affordability is a symptom of a problem we have yet to define. 

Or homelessness is a symptom of a problem we have yet too correctly define. 

Or misdemeanor property crime is a symptom of a problem we've yet to correctly define.

Or the West Seattle bridge wearing out too quickly is a symptom of a problem if you have to correctly define.

Seattle,"I don't often go out to restaurants and I never do food deliveries, so I rarely find myself in situations where I have the opportunity or expectation to tip. I've never had a job where I worked for tips. I've never liked tipping (who does?), but I do it because I felt it was expected. I was also under the impression that servers were relying on tips to make up for their lower than minimum wage wages - this is typically referred to as a ""[tip credit](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/15-flsa-tipped-employees)"".  

I came across [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/qo1jdx/people_in_ontario_debate_end_of_tipping_when/) about tipping in r/canada that prompted me to look into local laws in WA state. I came to learn that as of [March 2019](https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/_docs/esa12.pdf), it's not legal in WA state to impose a tip credit on workers. All workers must be paid at least minimum wage, and all tips are in addition to that wage. I was honestly surprised to learn this. Maybe this is common knowledge, but this was news to me. 

The [majority of states](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped) still have a tip credit for workers, so I wouldn't be surprised to hear that many WA state transplants are also unaware of this. 

I've always tipped in the past, but it was almost purely out of feeling obligated, and hardly ever out of feeling that the service was exceptional. In fact I frequently found myself tipping begrudgingly because I found the service to be lacking. Typically if the service was lacking I'd still tip what I felt was adequate or normal. If the service was exceptional then I'd generally tip above average. 

Now that I've learned about WA state not having a tip credit, I question why I even tip at all. I feel inclined to never tip again unless I felt the service was exceptional as apposed to tipping all the time regardless of the quality of the service.

The PNW has some obvious strong roots in Native culture.... there was dancing and food... there was singing. It was beautiful and felt like such a brilliant location... watching the sun set in the summer on the pier while they danced and sang.

Seattle,"I work in a property management office, so I am constantly scheduling dryer vent cleaning for rentals. It is a fire and a safety hazard to not have them cleaned at least once a year, but insurance agents are fine having it done every other year. 

My home, hasn't had a single thing done to it in over ten years due to a lazy and unorganized landlord. I do know that it is solely the responsibility and cost of the owner and the property manager to coordinate dryer vent cleaning (like, the big pipe in the wall, not the lint trap) and not the tenants responsibility at all, as I work in the field, and I'm telling the tenants that it' getting done. 

So my question is, say my dryer does catch on fire due to it not being cleaned for so many years, can I sue the property manager for negligence? Can I sue him even if it doesn't catch on fire, for negligence anyway? He is literally just a lazy piece of shit that doges everything to avoid doing his job.  I have to fight tooth and nail to get him to do the simplest things. SO even if I bring up that the dryer vents are way overdue, it would never get done.

However, Advisory Vote No. 37. Are you guys ok? Like, it wasn't even close. 63% said repeal!?

I thought I was doing well but you guys must be killing it cause if you're making in excess of $250k in capital gains that's a lot of money you're bringing in. Wow. And on top of that you're making that much bank and you also decide: ""nah, 7% back to help the community. That sounds like government overreach""

I just cannot understand progressive or conservative why this was repealed. Government spending has to be done. You know they will take this money another way right? Why did we just vote to help ultra wealthy and the ultra wealthy alone? If it was to ""stick it to the libs"" please tell me how this does that.

Edit 3: **THIS BILL EXCLUDES REAL ESTATE** Sorry, I thought this was in the wiki link I posted. If you argued about housing sorry. The actual bill is linked here and it excludes real estate.

[5096](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/5096-S%20AMS%20ROBI%20S1657.6.pdf)

Edit 4: I'm adding one of my comments as an example because so many people don't seem to understand how taxes work:


&gt; The first $250k is taxed at the standard capital gains rate of 15%. Which ends up being $37,500.

&gt; Anything ABOVE $250k is taxed at a 15+7% rate.

&gt; For example. If I made $300k in capital gains (bill excludes real estate btw) I get the same tax of 15% on the initial $250k and I am taxed $37,500 on it. Then the remaining $50k I am taxed at 22%. So I pay $11,000 on that. Making my total $48,500 and an ""effective tax rate"" of 16.1%

Edit 5: AHHHH! 401k's and similar retirement accounts are excluded! Please read voters guides and actual bills!

Edit 6: Thanks for all the discussion and great replies. I have spent a couple hours in here replying to post and will probably just let the discussion go on its own now. I hope a lot of people were educated in what capital gains is, how tax brackets and progressive tax systems work, and also learn to read the voters guide on everything they vote for.

**Mods:** I posted this about an hour ago and it disappeared. I have no idea where the post went. If it was removed by a mod, I don't know why. If this post somehow violates subreddit rules, could you shoot me a message and let me know?

Back to the analysis...

The election results are now rolling in. With only 132,667 votes counted as of 11/2 8:05PM and more than 206,814 votes expected (assuming higher turnout than the August primary), it's hard to draw any firm conclusions this early.

However, I took pulled up the results reported on primary night (August 3rd) and compared them with the results being reported tonight. Here's what I found:

\- On August 3rd, Bruce Harrell had 38.23% of the vote while Lorena Gonzalez held 28.55% of the vote (ratio of 1.34). Tonight (November 2nd 8:05PM), Bruce has 64.63% of the vote while Gonzalez has 35.02% (ratio of 1.85).

\- On August 3rd, Ann Davison had 34.64% of the vote while Nicole Thomas-Kennedy had 32.15% (ratio of 1.08). Tonight (November 2nd 8:05PM), Davison has 58.25% of the vote while Thomas-Kennedy has 40.96% of the vote (ratio of 1.42).

\- On August 3rd, Sara Nelson had 42.36% of the vote while Nikkita Oliver had 34.96% (ratio of 1.21). Tonight (November 2nd 8:05PM), Nelson has 60.31% of the vote while Oliver has 39.46% of the vote (ratio of 1.52).

\- On August 3rd, Teresa Mosqueda had 54.64% of the vote while Kenneth Wilson had 18.27% (ratio of 2.99). Tonight (November 2nd 8:05PM), Mosqueda has 52.40% of the vote while Wilson has 47.10% of the vote (ratio of 1.11).

So far it looks like Harrell, Davison, Nelson and Wilson are all outperforming their results from primary night. Raw percentages can be misleading (especially when it's a head-to-head vote versus a primary with many candidates), but the ratio of the votes have all shifted in their favor from primary night to election night.

If the voting patterns from the primary persist to this election, then their leads will shrink (or in the case of Wilson, fall further behind) as more votes are counted.","Early Analysis for 11/2 Election: Harrell, Davison, Nelson and Wilson out-performing primary results thus far"

I work in life sciences/biotech technical sales and am going into a raise/promotion discussion with my manager soon and would like to have the market rate to use as an estimate when asking for a raise.

I think I am underpaid based on my COL (live in Boston) compared to my colleagues who live in lower COL areas. I have many colleagues who work with clients in Boston but live in NH, and while I do not know what their pay exactly is, I think I am getting paid below average wage for my role and location and I am trying to survive in the city.

I was smitten with this role and did not have any competitive offers when I accepted the role so could not negotiate my salary much at the beginning but I am hoping to have a productive discussion with my manager and try to get enough raise to make up for the lower wages. Between lower wages and the high inflation this year, I will have to start looking for other jobs if they do not give me a decent wage. And yes, I can look for other jobs and bring the competitive offer to the table to negotiate, etc. but I am talking to my manager ASAP so some numbers to back up my ask would be great.

I have \~6 years of mix of academic lab and life sciences company experience.

Thank you!

boston,"Hello folks! 

I am trying to get some community opinions on something. 

Prior to Covid 19, I spent the four previous Christmas days preparing for, cooking for and hosting a holiday meal for strangers in my home. I fundraised for this event the 2nd, 3rd and 4th years all on my own, and enlisted the help of some generous neighbors who donated their time to help prepare the meal on the 3rd year. 

Last year, of course I was unable to host the dinner, but this year I am trying to figure out if I can do at least something. 

I had polled the community on Reddit and on other groups and come to some conclusions but on further thought I have come to a thought that maybe instead of trying to cook a meal at my house and transport it to different people, instead I could just fundraise to distribute Grubhub gift cards to different people. This way people could choose food that fits their dietary needs and personal preferences and I wouldn‚Äôt have to enlist the help of volunteer drivers.

Do you all think this would work? In past years I have fundraised $500 or more, so If I raised $25 per person I could potentially raise enough for 20 people.

The idea is that there would be an optional zoom call where we could gather together and have some company on Christmas Day and not spend the holidays alone, but still be socially distanced and safe.

Any thoughts?

boston,,My group of 6 has 2 under 21 people and we want to do something fun after dinner tonight. Any ideas?
boston,"Recently relocated to the Boston area from SF because my wife and I love it here and we wanted to raise our baby here. And as we close out the spectacularly beautiful technicolor wonderland of autumn, we've been thinking about our first winter nearly upon us now.

I've spent (parts of) several winters here, and we can't wait to experience our first full winter here (she's from Europe, so she's used to it). I've also spent (parts of) many winters throughout various European cities that also get cold, snowy winters. And there's two things that struck us: 

(1) Many people joke (or not) about the (apparently) very real seasonal depression that tends to strike in Boston due to the cold wintery days here, and the general lack of outdoor activities; 

(2) We've never really heard of this being an issue in most European cities; on the contrary, winter time in most European cities is a beautiful, bustling, lively time full of outdoor activity, music, food and drink in the parks, market vendors selling delicious bread, cheese, sausages, etc. This is true from London to Paris, Geneva to Munich, never mind the myriad Alpine ski resort towns.

And then it hit me: 

I noticed that Boston terraces tend to close down in the fall/winter, not just for fine dining, but for cafes and pubs too; and furthermore, that there isn't much in the way of little food/snack/beverage/vendor kiosks, either. In short, Boston -- like most (all?) American cities does indeed seem to go into hibernation come winter time. (Note: I'm excluding special pay-to-enter or one-off events.) To be fair, SF doesn't really have any outdoor activities during winter either; heck, SF all but abandoned any hint of holiday/Christmas decoration years ago too.

Again, this is in stark contrast to the norm across basically all of Europe, where, rather than essentially lock oneself up indoors all winter long, there's an endless sea of options to enjoy the otherwise bleak outdoors: 

Cafes and restaurant terraces remain open (yes, even while snow falls), but with heavy blankets and heat lamps aplenty; food/drink kiosks abound to warm your body (and soul) with tea, coffee, and of course hot wine; while a savory (or sweet) crepe satisfies your late night cravings; even vendors set up shop full of meats, cheeses, and various knick knacks. This of course all reaches a peak during the so-called Christmas Market time in December.

In fact, this is why my wife and I have headed to Europe every single winter: Except due to COVID last year, we haven't celebrated NYE in America in a decade; winter is just so much more fun in the Old World!

To be clear, I'm well-enough travelled that I'm not trying to presume Country X should be like Country Y; that's just stupid. America is America; Europe is Europe. Furthermore, I obviously don't expect late night cr√™peries to suddenly pop up across the US; that's just not our culture, I get that. But I don't understand why, if there's so much complaint about the depression that overtakes the population here come winter, and the general lack of social outdoor activities to help offset such depression, then why not at least borrow a page from European cities' playbooks and liven (and warm) things up a little? I can imagine a very real middle ground where, ok sure, we don't get cr√™pes on every corner, but perhaps at least hot dogs (like in NYC); or at least pizza. Or bread bowls of chowder. And yes, definitely hot wine. Or at least hot chocolate! Something! Anything!

I just think there's a tremendous lost opportunity -- not just in Boston, but American cities generally -- to capitalize on what could be not only the most truly beautiful, magical time of year, but indeed, the most lively and, ironically, the least depressing.

I refuse to believe there's just something patently American that precludes enjoying winter the same way our friends across the pond do.

Thoughts?","Needlessly long curiosity post: Since so many in Boston complain about the ""seasonal depression"" of cold, snowy winters forcing everybody indoors with nothing to do outside, why haven't we adopted the same outdoor cafe/pub/dining/kiosk/vendor culture as European cities to liven (and warm) things up?"

She has been trying to get her daycare voucher from the DTA since roughly February so that she can get back to work to support herself but they make it impossible. They never answer the phone and when they do they say they'll do something and get back to her but it never happens and she's stuck in this endless cycle. 2 months ago they said she would be getting the voucher soon so she registered her kids for daycare and has been waiting to hear back from them since. She calls almost daily but hasn't been able to reach anyone in 3-4 weeks now. It's so bad I get frustrated for her because she's not a lazy person and absolutely wants to become a contributing member of society again but the systems in place to help her are absolutely useless.

I have spent some time looking at the FAQ and reviewing some past posts, but thought I‚Äôd throw a post out there to see if anyone has any recommendations. 


I will be starting a new job at the prudential and would like to move closer. 

I currently live near fresh pond in Cambridge, and I feel a bit spoiled with how nice the area is, which I think is making it hard for me to find another area to live in. Especially since I haven‚Äôt been to the other side of the river all that much

My goals for a new neighborhood would be (I understand they can‚Äôt all be met):

- proximity to  a T stop (green or orange line) or waking distance to prudential. I am not super concerned about the commute time itself so long as I don‚Äôt have to change trains and busses to get there

- 2+ bed (will be just me and my partner) 

- a city center in the area that we can walk to to enjoy food/coffee etc. does not have to be huge, just providing some entertainment 

- short driving distance to a star market/wegmans/stop and shop 

- a parking spot or feasible street parking for residents 

- updated unit (not necessarily brand new, but kept and managed. Private or commercially owned)

- nice general ambience of the neighborhood: a park or 2 for example 


My budget would be around $3,600, give or take. So far I am looking at south end and the fens, but not sure if those are a good fit or not. 

Let me know if any area comes to mind, and I will be sure to take a look!","Where to live? Currently live in west Cambridge, starting a new job at prudential"

boston,"Hi there, it's your neighbor from the Pine Tree state. Just wanted to say thank you to Boston for being so cool.  
A few months ago, my gf and I met her parents in Boston as they were on their way to Cape Cod. We did mostly what they wanted, boomer things like the freedom trail and historical sites- which, to be fair, were pretty good, just not my jam. We also went to the ISG museum and that was great.

Well, this past weekend, my gf and I drove down by ourselves to see Hadestown at the Opera House and check out the Titian collection at the ISG museum. I highly recommend both while they are still available. I'm so-so with most musicals but Hadestown was a very fun time, and I'm not into painting at all but the Titian thing is a once-in-multiple-lifetimes chance. We also were lucky with the weather as everyone was out and about at the Common and other parks with their super-friendly dogs and playing music amidst the backdrop of the golden leaves. (Side-note about the opera house: Covid vaccine cards were required for entry and masks were required to be on, and even though the place was fairly packed, NO ONE CAUSED A SCENE.)

As for the taste buds: We wanted to specifically go for the more ethnic and cultural foods this time around. We grew up in the midwest and that place is culture-starved, to put it lightly. So we wanted to really branch out from what my gf's parents had us eat last time.  
For lunch we revisited Shawarma Falafel- we ate there last time because it was on the Wiki, and it was still awesome. For dinner we had a goal to just go into Chinatown and pick random places to eat as we strolled through and oh my god. Boston DELIVERED on that front. We hit up a couple Asian bakeries and had dinner at a Japanese hot-pot place. We waddled out of Chinatown many pounds heavier and very satisfied. The next day we ate at El Pel√≥n Taqueria in Fenway as a last-minute ""we didn't leave our lodging fast enough"" quick place on the way to our ticketed time for ISG. 100% would go back. Roughly $25 gave us more than plenty of food, especially because their plantain appetizer we got could feed like 4 people on its own. And everything we ordered had a fully different flavor from the next.  
After ISG we stopped by Napoles to get some food to go for our drive back. Their bakery has some amazing stuff and the best chicken empanada I've ever had in my life. The baker gave us some traditional Colombian sweet bread as a free gift and it was something I've never had anything like before- It's like delicious portable cinnamon bread pudding.  
Every place we ate at had like double the flavor of almost anything you'd get from my hometown or up here in Maine and we loved it.

And to add to all this: again, we grew up in the midwest, where people are, uh, generally not that enticing? My gf and I agree that you Bostonians are damn *hot*. You all looked great.

So thank you, Boston. We had a wonderful couple of visits and plan to be back after the winter or after I lose all the weight I put on from eating there, whichever comes first.  
And thank you to the writers &amp; contributors of the tourist wiki!  
Edit, re: the ""boomer things"" - We did almost all of the freedom trail during the first visit. It was mostly looking at graves and old buildings. Besides, I was already taught a lot of the impactful historical events that happened at those places back in school.

boston,"Does every homeowner in Boston proper just have it as a result of an inheritance? I was browsing real estate and the cheapest stuff I can find is like $600k USD 2 bd/ba condos with $1-2k HOA fees and a few extra hundred in insurance and property taxes per month.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Plaintiffs John Doe and Jane Doe (the ‚ÄúDoe Plaintiffs‚Äù) filed this lawsuit asserting various legal claims on behalf of a putative class of website users who were also patients. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants did not obtain sufficient consent when placing third party analytics tools, cookies, and pixels on their general and publicly accessible websites, including, for example, massgeneralbrigham.org, massgeneral.org, brighamandwomens.org, and dana-farber.org. Plaintiffs further allege that when using the Informational Websites, code on the Informational Websites caused the Plaintiffs‚Äô internet browsers to disclose information about Plaintiffs‚Äô internet use to third-parties through these analytics tools, cookies, pixels, and related technologies. The Doe Plaintiffs also filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Defendants from using the third-party website analytics tools, cookies, pixels, and related technologies on the general and publicly accessible Informational Websites. On November 20, 2020, the Suffolk Superior Court denied Plaintiffs‚Äô motion for preliminary injunction, after Defendants had revised the cookie banners and privacy disclosures on the Informational Websites, and granted in part, and denied in part, Defendants‚Äô motion to dismiss the case.

So I received two W2s in 2018. I reported both W2s in my federal return, obviously, and filed a separate Indiana state return for that $2000. But now MA wants me to pay them $116.

boston,"I‚Äôve lived in a few countries in my life ‚Äî  Asia, Australia and Dubai. I spent some time in the South and then came to Boston.

Maybe I‚Äôm just not finding the right restaurants but either food here just isn‚Äôt right or too expensive for what they serve.

What definitely makes Boston food great:

1. I‚Äôve not had a bad lobster roll since I got here and oysters are phenomenal, but that‚Äôs just not the kind of meal you have often. It‚Äôs also expensive.

2. Some chinese restaurants in Chinatown make really awesome authentic food, but they are few.

3. Seafood in general is pretty great.

4. Some local standalone restaurants are wonderful. A good one I went to recently was Prairie Fire in Brookline. 

What is in my opinion not so great:

1. Most if not all asian restaurants don‚Äôt serve authentic food. That‚Äôs fine since they cater to the American palette but the thing is it doesn‚Äôt even taste great. Some of the more popular asian fusion food here just put green curry(thai) with udon(japanese) and call it fusion and people lap it up. Australia had some of the best asian fusion restaurants that really had some creative flairs.

2. Pizza here has kind of been a let down. We went to the ‚Äúbest pizza in Boston‚Äù, the one under the bridge if you know, and it was underwhelming. North End also came out pretty disappointing with their pastas. 

3. Sushi is weird here. A lot of americanized rolls with weird names. Havent been able to find authentic ramen as well. We‚Äôve tried about 10. 

4. Burgers, fried chicken, that whole ‚ÄúAmerican experience‚Äù is also somehow lacking. When I was in the South, they made bombast fried chicken and the best soul food. Over here I pay $10 for a thin burger patty and a slab of cheese.

What do you guys think?",Can we discuss? I honestly don‚Äôt think Boston has a great food scene.

I have contacted them several times, trying to request them to return the rent. They ignore my emails, most calls end up with the front desk and they don't know anything. I  managed to make it through to the person in charge once and he said he'd send me a check the same day. This was a month ago and I have received nothing. Because I've only lived in the US for a few years, I'm not really familiar with the in and outs of the renting law here. Are there any steps that I can take to get my money back? Any Boston/Massachusetts authorities that I could contact? I don't think I can afford a lawyer but I really need that money back. The rents here are high enough without getting scammed out of a full months rent.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice! Of course, I should not have paid rent twice in the first place so that was definitively dumb, but this has been really helpful and you all have given me some good next steps to take.",Former property management withholding rent - MA possibilities for further action?

She and her partner were living in China, where they rescued their cat, and were out of the country when COVID hit. Because of the pandemic, they have not been able to get back to China to bring their cat home to Boston with them. They had found a temporary foster while they waited for a way to go back, but the foster family just abandoned the cat at an expensive boarding facility.

Being separated from their cat has been heartbreaking, and now they are running out of options. They have been unable to find a home for the cat there.

Should I reach out to the department and let them know of there mistake and see if they let it slide due to there error ( Probably not ) or just keep my mouth shut and show up to court with proof that my license was never suspended - best case i get lucky and it gets dismissed.

Last night I was pulled over in Somerville. My girlfriend was driving prior and had a headache so she pulled over and asked me to drive. We stopped on the side of the road switched seats and took off about 300ft up the road to a red light. At that point I noticed a police officer pull up on the right lane right next to us. She had seen us switch seats on the side of the road prior and I‚Äôm guessing since it was late night maybe thought there was an issue. Light turned green and I pulled off , she immediately got behind me and turned her lights on to pull me over. 

I pulled to the side of the road where it was safe and she approached my car. She explained that she pulled me over due to the ‚Äú21‚Äù sticker on my rear license plate not being ln it. I recently got a new inspection sticker and forgot to replace it. It was still paper clipped to my registration and she saw that as I handed it to her with my license. She was really nice , respectful and easy going. She told me she did see us switch seats initially and that‚Äôs what brought attention to my car in the first place. She told me to hang tight while she checked on some things. She came back and explained that my license was expired a month ago and asked if my girlfriends license was valid and if she could drive - she said yes. 

The officer went back to her vehicle for a moment and came back and told me she was going to be writing me a ticket for an expired license. And that she understands people forget sometimes and normally she would let me renew It on the spot and let me go with no ticket but that it has to go through the RMV and since it was late it wouldn‚Äôt get processed. She told me the ticket was no big deal and not to stress it - that I‚Äôll get a court date in the mail and just be sure to have the license renewed prior to the court date and they should let me go without to much trouble. Everything seemed cool , she explained everything thoroughly to me and allowed my girlfriend to drive us home. 

As we are driving down the highway I take a look at the ticket - to my surprise it says there is a criminal charge for driving with a suspended license. That is not what she pulled me over for , and is not what she said my ticket was for. I immediately thought to myself maybe I misunderstood her but there‚Äôs no way. I went on the MA license portal to check the status of my license as well as calling the DMV today and both show that my license is NOT suspended and hasn‚Äôt been at any time. I do need to renew my actual license as it‚Äôs expired and she was correct about that. 

Fast forward to now and I‚Äôm not sure what to do - Do I call the police department that issued the ticket and explain the situation and have them look into it and possibly ‚Äú fix the ticket‚Äù üòê, or do I keep my mouth shut and show up on the issued court date and show the judge proof of everything that my license was never suspended and just keep my mouth shut about everything else ?

I'm really unfamiliar with downtown Boston, because I just don't get out much, even before COVID.

Here's the rundown: spicy coconut milk mussels; grilled sweet house-cured pork tocino; roasted pork belly; twice-cooked chicken wings with sticky sweet fish sauce and ginger garlic oil; kabocha coconut milk puree with kabocha, Japanese eggplant, yardlong beans, and baby milk bok choy; crispy house pork sausage-filled lumpia spring rolls; soft-boiled adobo tea eggs with crispy shallot topping; Japanese medium grain rice; salad trio of ginger cucumber pickle, fish sauce tomato and pearl onion salad, and sweet and tangy green papaya slaw; and chopped pineapple and fresh tamarind fruit. Sauces include caramelized shrimp paste, garlic pepper-infused sugarcane vinegar, and spicy house sweet and sour. ""

Really, it sounds delicious and sounds like it will feed more than 2 people...

And the cost is $140.... for take-out... plus tax and they add a service charge... for take-out... that puts the total cost (for pick-up - Doordash even more) up to about $180... ""for two"".... for take-out....

I have read the reviews and it sounds like people ""in the know"" really love the place, so I was willing to do $140 for take-out for this special occasion, but then the actual cost was $180 and ....

Dog is reddish brown with white around the face and answers to Watson; he's dragging a fifteen foot leash so he's very likely caught on something.

boston,"Radiator heat managed by the building. In my past apartments, this meant it was about 90 degrees and I'd crack a window. This place is 59-61 degrees (measured on a non-exterior wall at a height of 5' - in other areas, of the apartment it's even colder, especially for example when sitting 2-3' off the ground). MA law requires 64 at night, 68 during the day.

This was a problem all last winter too, and the building did check out a few things like making sure my radiators were in good working order (they are). They basically said ""well if we turn it up then it's too hot for the other units and we would need to pay for multiple service calls to figure out a compromise across units with 100 year old heating system.""

I understand that. However, it \*is\* a new fancy boiler system, with honestly the best looking radiators (and quietest) I've ever seen. The system appears to have been maintained well. And, ultimately, they are responsible for maintaining proper temperature in the units.

What is a reasonable solution here? My thoughts:

* They can provide a space heater or two. I don't know if those are actually legal, and I also don't want to be stuck with the electric bill for that when proper heat is supposed to be included.
* They could add a 3rd wireless thermostat to the system installed in my unit, but if other apartments are too hot already, I could see that not making a difference. (60 + 80 + 80)/3 = 73, they stay too hot and I stay too cold.
* They could pay for and install plastic window coverings, but I did that myself last year and did not measure a difference in temperature.
* The *real* answer is likely replacing the original 120yo windows throughout the building, and maybe adding some insulation in the exterior walls. Since they just replaced the boiler last year I'd think they're several years away from another large improvement project like that, and I don't reasonably expect my complaints to initiate this kind of project.

Anyone with experience here care to weigh in? It's a well maintained building without your usual slumlord issues, however while responsive verbally, they did not solve the problem last winter. I'm looking to be firm, but reasonable.",Reasonable expectations to get an apt to meet legal heating requirements?

boston,"I‚Äôve been watching Covid numbers pretty closely. Over the past week there were 188 new cases and 2 deaths in Suffolk County, a county with a population of 800,000.

When there was no vaccine, I adamantly supported mask-wearing.    When the vaccines came out, there is no denying the messaging was ‚Äúget a vaccine and you don‚Äôt have to wear a mask.‚Äù

I am vaccinated.  I have done my part.  Are we now not catering to those who refuse to get vaccines, believing masks are preferable or ‚Äògood enough?‚Äô  Would these holdouts not be more motivated to get vaccinated if they were required to show proof of vaccination to enter businesses, like in Los Angeles and NYC?

It is time. The numbers don‚Äôt support a mask mandate in Boston, one of the most highly vaccinated cities in the country.  We don‚Äôt even have metrics set by which the mandate would be lifted.   

I thought we were ‚Äútrusting science‚Äù on this?  Breakthrough cases are 1% or less of the vaccinated population.  Is it not, if nothing else, really bad form to set expectations one way (get vaxxed and no masks) and then decide to go back on that when numbers do not support it?  This has been a reactionary response.  We are currently achieving the low infection rates we were hoping for.  

Booster doses only give further reason to lift the mask mandate- high risk, responsible individuals can get themselves another dose for additional protection.  The approval of Pfizer for children 5-11 this week is another huge step.  Are we just ignoring this progress?

Covid is not going to go away.  There will always be cases.  So what‚Äôs the plan?  We can‚Äôt keep this up indefinitely, infection and death rates are teeny-tiny fractions of what they were pre-vaccines, and we are enabling anti-vaxxers.  This is not a common sense, science-based, or data-based approach.

Though they didn't have an exact timeline for when the replacement was going to happen, we received an email this morning stating that the replacement date is set for Nov 15th.

During the replacement, there will be about 3 days where the building will have no heat or hot water. Looking at the weather forecast, the nights are going to be pretty cold (about 37¬∞F). 

They don't mention anything about compensating in any way, and I wonder if I can ask if they can discount next month's rent since I'll have to buy some things to keep warm. My understanding is that MA law requires these fixes to be done within 24 hours, but I could be wrong.

Also opposing: The Massachusetts Addiction Prevention Alliance, which says a large liquor store is the absolute wrong thing to put at the edge of Methadone Mile. Alliance President Heilman said the giant store would just prove too much of a lure for local people with additions and predicted that 75% of the store's business would be among people who would drink two handles of hard liquor a day if they could.

boston,"TL;DR: did research and visited, need some more advice finding a neighborhood that isn‚Äôt too crowded, is nice for walking dogs, and not too far from the Alewife/Allston area. 

My wife and I are potentially moving to Boston (from Seattle) soon for work and we just got back from visiting for a few days to check out the city to decide if it is a fit for us.

We really enjoyed downtown as it was quite refreshing compared to downtown Seattle which is not very pleasant to be in, but downtown living doesn‚Äôt really suit us (esp. with active dogs and me who likes his nature). I did some research into the neighborhoods around Boston, so we spent a full day driving around to different neighborhoods and were really discouraged. They either were not nice and crammed full of houses with little green in sight or were too expensive. We went to Watertown, Waltham, Cedarwood, Waverley, Belmont, Lib Heights, Arlington, Somerville, Newton, W Roxbury, Hyde Park, Dorchester, and W Boston. Clearly discouraging when they were the ‚Äútop‚Äù neighborhoods that I researched. Similar pattern in Seattle where the neighborhoods we really don‚Äôt like are listed as top areas‚Ä¶.

General criteria for finding a place: relatively quiet area with some elbow room between houses. Needs to be a safe neighborhood for walking dogs and ideally near some big parks (not necessarily off-leash). A yard would be fantastic, but if not, proximity to big parks and good sidewalks for walking are a must. Last big thing would be that we are not a terribly long driving commute from the Alewife/Allston area. Since we will be new to the area and are unsure how long we will stay, renting would likely be our best option (townhouse preferred over apartment). 

Since returning home, I‚Äôve had a few Redfin emails from the Melrose area that appear better than what we visited, how is that area?

Long post, I know, but if anybody has some suggestions for us, we would really appreciate it as this is a big sticking point for our decision.  Also, if these criteria are too restrictive, feel free to tell me what may be more reasonable!

Edit: budget somewhere $3-4k/mo, probably closer to 3.5k.","Discussion about finding fitting neighborhood to move to (fear not, research and visit already done!)"

boston,"There is 25 of us living in an intentional community (i.e. a cooperative living arrangement). We don't pay ""rent"", but we pay ""educational fees"" instead, and I'm sure that this is a legal nuance which enables them to kick us out instead of evicting us since we are technically NOT tenants.

Anyways, the coop entails 2 buildings. As you know, here in New England, the buildings are very old, and they're heated with radiator style of furnaces. I have no control of the heat. It's controlled by someone else in my building. 

It gets way too hot here for me, so I frequently have the windows opened while I'm in my home.  I still have my window unit AC which I still use. 

Today, the ""abbot"" of this coop, who is the leader, wrote me an email saying: **""We spoke at the house meaning about not having windows open when the heat is on. I noticed that you have one window open which is fine if your heat is off. Today it‚Äôs in the 40s so if your heat is on at all it‚Äôs going out the window and your building has oil heat so it‚Äôs very expensive. That wasn‚Äôt true when the weather was in the 60s but your heat will keep trying to keep the room temperature whatever it‚Äôs set at as it loses heat through the window. Do you have your own thermostat or how does that work? Thanks much for helping the planet and also our expenses.""**

There's something here that's concerning to me. This ""abbot"" mentioned that I have ""one window open,"" but this is NOT the case. It's NOT a window that's opened. It's my AC unit which we've always were allowed to have. Moreover, it's not mandated to take down our AC.

boston,"Now that it's certain Councilor Michelle Wu will be the next Mayor of Boston, it's time to Kim Janey to step down as City Council President, allowing Michelle Wu to immediately step into the role of Acting Mayor without a confusing two weeks when city officials will be ignoring all leadership from the Acting Mayor, and instead will follow the leadership of the Mayor-elect anyway.

Last month, Janey [very graciously offered](https://www.boston.gov/news/mayor-janey-hosts-meeting-essaibi-george-wu-set-mayoral-transition-date) to have the November 3 election results certified on November 16, giving herself an extra two weeks in the Mayor's office.  If the election results were close, warranting a hand recount and extra scrutinization of every ballot, then November 16 might be a reasonably conservative date to certify results.  But that is not the case at all.  The election was decided by a landslide.  There is no doubt who won.

If Kim Janey vacates the role of City Council President, the City Council at its meeting today can elect Michelle Wu the new City Council President, automatically and cleanly making her the Acting Mayor of Boston until the election results are ready to be certified and Wu can be (legally) sworn in as Mayor of Boston.  Janey can also immediately resume the duties of presiding over the City Council, and be formally reelected City Council President for the remainder of 2021 after Wu is sworn in.

It's important to remember that Janey's stint as Acting Mayor does not have a ""term"".  Whenever the Mayor of Boston resigns, is incapacitated, or even crosses the Charles River, then the city charter confers the role Acting Mayor on the City Council President.  This is just to have someone who can make time sensitive actions that cannot wait (e.g. signing a grant application that's due today).  The Acting Mayor is only supposed to do that until the Mayor is back.

The City Council could make Wu its new President [without action by Janey](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2021/06/09/boston-city-council-power-to-recall-acting-mayor-kim-janey/) but it would be classier and more democratic if Janey proactively initiated the transition herself.",Kim Janey should step down today as City Council President

boston,"The city is NOT an amusement park. 

Yes, yes. I knew this before I went there but I just wanted to learn the lesson first hand I guess. 

Don't drive there they said. Take public transport. And so I did. 

Reached North Station at 11. Trains were running every hour to Salem so it was quite a wait I thought. Boy, was I wrong. The line snaked 4-5 times inside the north station before heading out. Took an hour and a half. Boarded the train - and guess what. The train stopped at Lynn. Some idiot had fireworks in the next compartment. 

Took 2 hrs to reach Salem. But the nightmare wasn't over. 

It started raining as I reached there. And that place wasn't ready. 

Thousands had descended upon that tiny town like locusts. All restaurants were more than full. I went in naively to ask for a seat - and I was told with a smirk that the wait time was two hours. 

Anyway I went off to tour other haunted houses - which were obviously not ready for the huge crowd. 

I was one of those idiots. 

It took an hour and a half to get back to the trains - with the station entrance closed down. Another snaking line - which extended half a mile over the bridge next to the station (go up and down - and around - is what a cop told me). 

Got back to Boston at 9. I think I hardly spent an hour or two in Salem. It was a beautiful little town. Swamped by us, the uninformed idiots.

This one came a bit out of the blue for me, I hadn't heard anything about it until l started getting mail about it. Looks like the plan is to strip the mayor's office of most its budgetary powers. That's not the black letter law, but it effectively makes it so that if the city council can get a super majority to agree on a budget, they can force it through regardless of the mayor's opinion. When it comes down to getting half of the city council to agree with a budget they have modest input into or two-thirds to agree on one they wrote themselves, I'm guessing the latter will be more common, as that ensures that more folks can have their pet projects funded.

Anyone else have thoughts on this? Is there any reason it has flown under the radar more than past questions?",Any thoughts on Question 1?

Edit: I think I‚Äôve gotten plenty of suggestions, thank you everyone.

Tada! An automatic response seconds later saying that I'd been removed from the list. It was a generic error message, apparently from the vendor they're using for the service.

I bet they changed the ""confirm to remove"" response text to be blank, and that when you message ""STOP"" a second time, that triggers the vendor's ""yeah, we don't want to get sued under CAN-SPAM"" function regardless of what their customer does.
